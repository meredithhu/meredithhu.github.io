  <!--<h3>Essay 1: Suspense and Surprise: Evidences from Movie, Sport, Music and Crowdfunding </h3>
  <ul>
	<li><a href=""> This paper develops new measures of suspense and surprise in multiple distinct contexts and document robust heterogenous effects of how experienced surprise drives consumer experience and market outcomes. We motivate our analysis using Ely, Frankel and Kamenica’s (2015) model of demand for non-instrumental information goods, which prescribes how suspense and surprise (and possibly other aspects of belief dynamics) shape the experienced utility function of consumers. To test the idea of the model, we develop analogous yet distinct measures of (1) functional, (2) textual, (3) visual, (4) aural suspense and surprise in four corresponding contexts: (1) NFL viewership, (2) movie consumption, (3) logo designs and (4) consumption of streaming music.  We find that experienced surprise (1) Granger causes more audience response and more positive sentiments towards NFL games, (2) leads to higher evaluation of movies, (3) causes consumers to remember logos better, and (4) more likely to favorite and include songs in their personal playlists.

     <li><p> Abstract:</p></li> 
    <li><a href=""> We empirically test a consumer demand model for non-instrumental information goods proposed in Ely, Frankel and Kamenica (2015) that describes how suspense and surprise 
(and possibly other aspects of belief dynamics) shape the experienced utility function of consumers in two distinct settings: (1) movie consumption and (2) sports viewership. First, drawing on the concept of clause Transitivity in computational linguistics and emotion analysis methods 
in natural language processing, we introduce new empirical measures of narratives with respect to suspense and surprise. 
We show that our automatic method of measuring suspense and surprise in scripts agrees with human annotated labels of suspense and surprise to much extent. Using screenwriter guild strikes, regional political and natural events, writers’ demographics and writers’ other writing samples as instrumental variables, We document empirical evidences in a sample of 1088 movie scripts and corresponding consumer data 
      in support of consumer preferences for surprise. Second, by aligning NFL play-by-play data and corresponding viewer sentiments crawled from Twitter for two seasons, we provide further causal evidence that audience experience measured by real-time sentiments expressed on social media is driven by surprise rather than suspense.</a></li>

  <h3>Essay 2: Playlist Curation and the Consumption of Music</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href=""> As the streaming music industry gains momentum, music play-listing has become 
the new battlefield for major streaming service providers. We study the role of play-lists in shaping consumer music listening 
behavior by asking two questions: (1) given a music play-list (a sequence of tracks), how should we specify and 
estimate a utility function of for an individual consumer? (2) how does a consumer create her own music play-lists given what she has listened to in the past? We propose a two-stage sequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks combined with explicit and implicit 
preferences for individual tracks from a hazard and a discrete choice model. In 
the first stage, consumers encode tracks they have listened to into their 
memory, represented as sequence embeddings augmented by revealed preferences; in 
the second stage, they create their own personal play-lists based on retrieved 
memory encoded in the first stage. We model and visualize consumers' music memory 
formation and retrieval processes of consumers using a dataset of consumer music streaming and 
play-listing behavior. We find substantial consumer heterogeneity and uncover three behavioral patterns in play-listing 
behaviors (1) "narrow bracketing"; (2) "bunching"; (3) "Peter Pan" --- and their respective activated features, given revealed preferences for individual tracks.

  <h3> Essay 3: A Neural Algorithm for Visual Design</h3>
  <ul>
	  
    <li><a href=""> We propose, and provide scalable methods to measure and evaluate two independent constructs for iconic images representing business entities: (1) style complexity; and (2) content ambiguity, drawing on perception research, computer vision and information theory. We introduce an experimental procedure to objectively measure consumer memory of logos, allowing us to build LogoMem, the largest annotated logo memorability dataset to date. We explore the link between icon memorability, style complexity and content ambiguity by testing the hypothesis 
that an icon is more memorable when its style complexity is relatively low and yet its content ambiguity is relatively high, 
demonstrating the memorability effect of distinctive content built on a scaffolding of common patterns in the domain of business icons. 
We propose a neural algorithm based on a constrained Generative Adversarial Network for logos design that generates visually-plausible icon designs, optimally combining style complexity and content ambiguity 
given the nature and position of a business entity. </a></li>
