A.K.A. Quantitative marketing research papers that have used image processing or computer vision methods

Dzyabura, Ibragimov and Kihal (2018) use machine learning models to predict demand in online and offline retail channels, as well as returns for new products. They measure sale distributions across channels for each product category and find those predominantly sold online are more prone to customer returns. They also demonstrate the superior prediction performance when product image features — color histograms, texture, learned representa- tion by training AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton 2012) — are included.

Zhang, Lee, Singh and Srinivasan (2018) estimate the economic impact of images and low-level image features that property demand in Airbnb. By classifying property photos with computer vision and deep learning models, they show that 48.9% of the effect of verified images boosting demand comes from the high image quality. They also identify 12 image at- tributes based on marketing and photography literature and demonstrate the direct impacts of these on demand after controlling for many obserables, thus prescribing optimal product image strategies to increase demand for housing and lodging managers.
