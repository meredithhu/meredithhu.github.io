As I have been happily working on martingales yet again after a four-year spell, I am remineded of what has lead me to where I am...

Memorylessness of Poisson processes: whatever happened in the past goes away, wipe a clean slate and make a difference now... (aw)

Doob martingale: whatever priors and beliefs you held have led you to a more stable self, conditional on your past experiences... (duh)

Brownian motions, mirrored: don't beat yourself up about the counterfactuals (could haves, should haves, would haves), every infinitesimal moment is subject to random purturbations... (>_<)
