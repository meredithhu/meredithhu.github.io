  <p>NYC wine bars and wine stores --- my personal reviews:</p>
	<ol>
  <li>Aldo Sohm: excellent wine list, 9pm pours, and the somms there love to geek out with you!</li>
  <li>Terrior: by the one and only Paul Grieco, the menu/wine list is fun, informative, and excellent!</li>
  <li>La Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels: great wine list, fun blind tasting gimmick!</li>
  <li>Casellula: features wine and cheese - solid wine list, they appear to have quite some favorite producers, which show up in the list again and again and again --- they are fantastic producers for sure, but I would prefer more variety. </li>
  <li>The Ten Bells: with this glassware? Seriously? All natural wines. Not a fan despite the hype.</li>
  <li>Astor: the largest and the most comprehensive, region/type discounts every Tuesday/Wednesday/..., some mega tastings are awesome.</li>
  <li>Union Square Wine: smaller but a bit more boutique than Astors. I personally frequent their tasting events. Their Sake, Georgian, German, and California selections stand out to me.</li>
  <li>Flatiron Wine: smaller but even more boutique than Union Square. Their events are awesome. </li>
  <li>Sherry-LehmannÂ® Wines: solid selection overall, somewhere in-between UNS and Flatiron.</li>
  <li>Verve Wine: went for the Master Somm there...</li>
  </ol>
