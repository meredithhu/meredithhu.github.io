	<h5>Thank you for stopping by my website!</h5>
	<h5>I am a fifth-year PhD student at the Johnson School of Cornell University, </h5>
	<h5>majoring in Management with foci on Information Management and Marketing, minoring in Computer Science and Statistics.</h5>
	<h5>I am on the job market seeking ML/AI research scientist or data scientist positions. </h5>
	<h5>With years of training and research experience in multiple disciplines spanning experimental/behavioral economics, applied statistics, machine learning (computer vision & 
		natural language processing), marketing, and operations management, </h5>
	<h5>I am lucky enough to have published in top journals and conferences in natural language processing, computer vision, and applied statistics; </h5>
	<h5>and given the opportunities to give various talks at major conferences in operations research, business, quantitative marketing, natural language processing, and computer vision. </h5>
	<h5>My dissertation "Information Design with Big Data" can be summarized as solving business problems and providing managerial insights with machine learning (language and vision) methods and big data. </h5>
